Dependent Object Types (DOT)
----------------------------

The DOT calculus proposes a new foundation for Scala's type system.

DOT has been presented at the FOOL 2012 workshop
([PDF](http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~amin/dot/fool.pdf)).

We are working towards a mechanized type safety proof.
This repo implements the model in Coq, based on previous work in the
[namin/dot](https://github.com/namin/dot) and
[TiarkRompf/minidot](https://github.com/TiarkRompf/minidot) repos.
