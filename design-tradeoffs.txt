DOT design tradeoffs
--------------------

There are several boolean choices (have/don't have it):

b bb-env   bad-bounds environment: The typing environment can contain types
           with type members whose lower bound is not a subtype of the upper bound
t bot-env  bottom environment: The typing environment can contain (x: Bot) and
           (x: T), where T has fields of type Bot
u u-has    unique has: path membership is precise and thus unique
x bot-exp  Bot expands to D_Bot, the declaration set which contains all declarations
  sbsm     subsumption for typing
  trans    transitivity for subtyping

and many restrictions between these.

If we want sbsm, we need trans in the inversion lemmas.
trans doesn't work with bb-env.

(not (x and t) or b) and (not (t and u) or x) and not b and u
