The problem with precise expansion
----------------------------------

In preservation/case red_call, we have

G, y': T2 |- body : U

and

G |- y : T2      i.e.   (y:T1) in G  and G |- T1 <: T2

and we want to go to

G |- [y/y']body : U

We can achieve this in two ways:

1) Using a substitution lemma which takes the precise [(y:T1) in G],
   but then we have to narrow [G, y': T2 |- body : U] to [G, y': T1 |- body : U]
   before we can use it.

2) Trying to avoid narrowing, we could use a substitution lemma which accepts
   an imprecise [G |- y : T2].

In both cases, we might have to replace a [y'.L <z Ds2] judgment (in which the precise
type of y' is T2) by a [y.L <z Ds1] judgment (in which the precise type of y is T1).

But if there are intersection types, the existence of an expansion can be lost through
narrowing, because narrowing can introduce cyclic upper bounds (see FOOL'12 paper).

So none of the two ways works, and we cannot use a precise expansion judgment.
